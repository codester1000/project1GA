## Planning and Development Process
Planning was mostly done using a written formula of the process because it was easier to visualise the process. 
Handwriting helps me visualise a long winded process of creating a complicated website, which includes many different steps that can lead to a website. I can thereofore work through each step of the process, and branch off into creative ideas and additions to the website.

## Unsolved Problems
The two unsolved problems are almost complete, but have a few bugs that need to be fixed. The first is: 
1. A hover function that shows you where you are about to click. This failed because it wouldnt work withe click event listnener, not sure why?
2. The other was a randomized fucntion that would play against you in a random pattern, this is much easier to fix, I just had problems with time as I added more functionality with the front end than I first envisioned.

Additionally, I wish i created a formula that would predict whether you won using a mathematical formula rather than an array of winning conditions. This could help when the size of the board changes.

## Favourite Functions
My favourtie function is the function that adds in a line that crosses over when you win, this because I designed all the images, and then mapped their name to the exact '[number]' of the win condition that is mapped to it.
I very much enjoyed creating the function that tells you if you won or not, using the winningConditions array.
